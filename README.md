## Single cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-seq) Analysis of Pediatric Low Grade and High Grade Gliomas with Cell-type Annotation ##

Single-cell transcription analysis, particularly single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), is a powerful technique that allows researchers to examine the gene expression of individual cells within a complex tissue. Instead of averaging gene expression across a bulk sample, this method provides a high-resolution view of cellular heterogeneity. This is exceptionally important for cancer research because tumors are not uniform masses; they consist of diverse cell populations, including cancer cells, immune cells, and stromal cells, each with unique transcriptional profiles. Understanding this cellular diversity is crucial for:   

- **Identifying cancer subtypes:** scRNA-seq can reveal previously unknown cancer cell subpopulations, leading to more precise tumor classification.   
- **Deciphering tumor microenvironments:** It allows researchers to map the interactions between cancer cells and their surrounding cells, which play a vital role in tumor growth and metastasis.   
- **Understanding drug resistance:** By analyzing gene expression changes in individual cells, researchers can identify mechanisms of drug resistance and develop more effective therapies.   
- **Advancing immunotherapy:** Single-cell analysis helps in characterizing immune cell populations within tumors, which is essential for developing and optimizing immunotherapies.

This project uses single cell RNA datasets from the Single-cell Pediatric Cancer Atlas Portal (SCPCA)
